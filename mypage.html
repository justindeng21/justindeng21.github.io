        <h1>Deng, Justin</h1>
        <p>I really enjoy playing basketball; I could play forever if given the chance. I love rainy days and how peaceful they can be. I also have a horrible dependency on coffee. I don't really enjoy the physical action of programming, but I really do love having the ability to create what I want. Being involved in a project is such an exciting thing for me; Data structures was such a fun class for me because of the project at the end of the year. It made me really consider what we could do with code.</p>
